# Auto-Attendance-System

CS6309 - Java Programming - Course Project

Maintenance of attendance is an important task in every school and colleges since it is one of the primary ways to check the regularity of every student. As of now, attendance in schools and colleges is done by maintaining the attendance sheet which is a time-consuming procedure.


Being virtually present in online mode, verifying each student in the class is difficult. Hence, the mechanism of face detection and face recognition method is proposed to maintain the attendance. It not only save the time but, also provides a feeling of virtually present in offline classes as the students keep their video on throughout the class and it does not allow proxy or false attendance. This system, which is based on HAAR Cascade Classification and LBPH algorithms, detects and recognizes the presence of student via the webcam throughout the class session. It stores the time-series data at regular intervals and by the end of the class it calculates the attendance percentage

Tech stack used :
- GUI – JavaFx with FXML
- Database – MySQL
-	IDE - IntelliJ
-	Face Detection and Recognition – JavaCV + OpenCV for Java
